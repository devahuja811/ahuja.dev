								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/intro.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am an undergraduate at UMass Amherst pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm experienced in fast-paced, collaborative environments from software development experiences at various organizations. My skills mainly include Python, Java, C/C++, React.js, Kubernetes, and AWS. I take great interest in automation through software, systems design, data engineering, and playing table-tennis during lunch breaks. Make sure to check out some of my <a href="#about">projects!</a>.</p>
								<p>During my free time, I enjoy traveling, researching new technology, experimenting with personal projects, and investing in the stock market. I am currently a software developer at <a href="https://buildumass.com/">BUILD UMASS</a> where I assist in providing software solutions to local businesses that do not have access to professional software development.   </p>

								<h3>AI/ML Intern</h3>
								<h5> <i>Balbix: Summer 2022</i></h5>
								As a summer intern at Balbix, I designed a highly efficient and scalable graph database using Neo4j that allows clients to consolidate and visualize
								data from 30,000+ companies and approximately 201,000 potential cyber-attacks and breaches. I further reduced the existing identification time for potential risks by 60% and implemented a feature to provide
								recommendations for prevention methods at runtime for an asset. At the end, I containerized the database using Kubernetes to automate graph updates and reformations, and reduced
								dashboard-server latency and query time by 54%.

								<h3>Software Developer</h3>
								<h5><i>BUILD UMASS: Sept. 2021-Present</i></h5>
								I am part of a software development organization that provides software solutions to 12 local businesses that do not have access to professional software development.
								We also assist campus organizations in designing visually appealing layouts for their websites and refining existing features to improve user experience using React.js.

								<h3>Undergraduate Course Assistant</h3>
								<h5><i>Manning College of Information and Computer Science: May 2022- Present</i></h5>
								I am currently aiding 250+ students in comprehending course material and completing projects for a course on Search Engines,
								offering individualized assistance and resources. I aim to create a supportive and engaging learning environment through group problem-solving sessions and discussions
								on connecting course content to real-life use cases.
								<p></p>

								<h3>Software Engineering Intern</h3>
								<h5><i>Net Solutions: Summer 2019</i></h5>
								As my first professional software development experience, I optimized client web applications for maximum speed and reliability by automating features that previously
								required user interference. I conducted and executed 130+ unit tests for websites to ensure consistent cross-platform performance. I was also able to successfully adopt Agile development methodologies to deliver high-quality products iteratively and
								incrementally that received positive client feedback.

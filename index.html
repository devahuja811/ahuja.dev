								<h3>Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
								<h5><i>Balbix</i></h5>
								I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Balbix where I am developing deep learning algorithms for statistical modeling of enterprise cybersecurity risk within a confidential
								project environment. I am applying AI-supported data-mining techniques to address modeling, recommendation, and threat detection.
								<p></p>

								<h3>AI/ML Intern</h3>
								<h5> <i>Balbix</i></h5>
								As a summer intern at Balbix, I designed a highly efficient and scalable graph database using Neo4j that allows clients to consolidate and visualize
								data from 30,000+ companies and approximately 201,000 potential cyber-attacks and breaches. I further reduced the existing identification time for potential risks by 60% and implemented a feature to provide
								recommendations for prevention methods at runtime for an asset. At the end, I containerized the database using Kubernetes to automate graph updates and reformations, and reduced
								dashboard-server latency and query time by 54%.

								<h3>Undergraduate Course Assistant</h3>
								<h5><i>Manning College of Information and Computer Science</i></h5>
								I aided 250+ students in comprehending course material and completing projects for a course on Search Engines,
								offering individualized assistance and resources. It was my aim to create a supportive and engaging learning environment through group problem-solving sessions and discussions
								on connecting course content to real-life use cases.
								<p></p>

								<h3>Software Engineering Intern</h3>
								<h5><i>Net Solutions</i></h5>
								As my first professional software development experience, I  Automated client web application features to improve speed and reliability, eliminating the need for user
								interference. I conducted and executed 130+ cross-platform unit tests to ensure consistent performance of websites.
